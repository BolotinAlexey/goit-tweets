# Tweets

### This app can help you find a friend.

The application is designed in the form of user cards.Contains two pages. The
first part of cards is loaded when you run application. If you have previously
logged into the application, the cards are loaded from your browser's local
storage, and the state of the cards is saved. The number of cards loaded from
the backend depends on the constant and is by default equal to 6. When you click
on the "follow" button, its color and label change, and you are added to the
number of followers. When pressed again, the opposite effect occurs.
